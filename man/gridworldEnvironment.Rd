\description{
Function defines an environment for a 2x2 gridworld example. Here an agent is intended to
navigate from an arbitrary starting position to a goal position. The grid is surrounded by a wall,
which makes it impossible for the agent to move off the grid. In addition, the agent faces a wall between s1 and s4.
If the agent reaches the goal position, it earns a reward of 10. Crossing each square of the grid results in
a negative reward of -1.

# Load gridworld environment
gridworld <- gridworldEnvironment

# Define state and action
state <- "s1"
action <- "down"

# Observe next state and reward
gridworld(state, action)
